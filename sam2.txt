Overall Architecture

The diagram depicts a layered architecture, a common approach for building scalable and maintainable applications. It's divided into three primary tiers:

Web Tier: Handles the presentation layer, responsible for user interaction.
App Tier: Contains the application logic, including business rules and data processing.
Processing Tier: Interacts with the database and performs data operations.
Web Tier

HTTPS: The application uses the HTTPS protocol for secure communication between the client and the server.
HTTP Server: The web server receives incoming requests from clients.
LDAP: The application utilizes Lightweight Directory Access Protocol for authentication and authorization.
Services: This layer exposes various services, such as Customer Search, Dimension Service, Closed Accounts, Holiday Calendar, Exchange Rate Service, and Batchload.
App Tier

Web Logic: The application uses WebLogic as the application server to host and manage the application components.
App Dependencies: The application relies on common utilities and entities for its functionality.
Job Execution: This layer handles background tasks and scheduled jobs.
Processing Tier

Controller: The controller acts as the central point for handling incoming requests and routing them to appropriate services.
Service Layer: This layer contains the core business logic and data processing functionalities.
DAO (Data Access Object): The DAO layer interacts with the database to retrieve and store data.
Database

Oracle DB: The application uses an Oracle database to store and manage its data.
Key Components

CAC: Component Access Control
Portfolio: A collection of components
Chained Component: A component that triggers other components
Component Creation, Execution, and Search: These components handle the lifecycle of application components.
Flow

A client sends a request to the HTTP server.
The request is routed to the appropriate controller based on the request type.
The controller delegates the request to the corresponding service layer component.
The service layer component processes the request, which might involve data retrieval from the database using the DAO layer.
The processed data is returned to the controller.
The controller formats the response and sends it back to the client.
Additional Notes

The diagram doesn't explicitly show the communication protocols between the tiers.
The specific implementation details of the components and their interactions might vary depending on the actual application.
