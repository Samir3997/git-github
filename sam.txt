Thank you for bringing this matter to my attention. I appreciate the opportunity to clarify the situation regarding my CIBIL score.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2022-2023, I faced significant financial challenges due to unforeseen circumstances. I had taken a loan for house construction, and during that time, I also encountered a medical emergency that required urgent attention. Additionally, I am the sole earner in my family, which further contributed to my temporary financial strain. As a result, I was unable to make timely EMI payments for a few months, which unfortunately impacted my credit score.

However, I want to assure you that I have taken proactive steps to address this issue. I have resumed regular payments and am actively working on improving my credit standing.

I understand the importance of maintaining a healthy credit score and am committed to resolving this matter.

Thank you for your understanding.
