Subject: Request for Asset Submission Clarification

Dear [Payroll Team],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I have received an offer letter for a permanent position with the client company, and my employment is transitioning accordingly. As part of this transition, I am being asked to submit the company assets assigned to me.

However, I would like to clarify that I will continue to use the same assets in my new role with the client company. Therefore, I kindly request that the asset submission process be deferred, as I will not need to return the assets.

Please let me know if you require any further information or documentation regarding this transition.

Thank you for your understanding and assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
