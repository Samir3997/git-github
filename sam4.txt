"select * from component_defn ;
select * from component_filter_defn ;
select * from component_request_measures ;
select * from component_hierarchy_defn ;" i have these 4 tables where component_defn is the root table. 
SO from UI if user types I want Total exposure of the current date for country MY.
So here exposure is column in component_request_measures  and date is like some column in component_filter_defn  and country is like some column in 
component_hierarchy_defn .
So below is the column for reference
v_comp_req_measure_formula(component_request_measures  table)=SUM({ Accrued Interest Amount })
V_FILTER_NME(component_filter_defn table)=Extraction Date
V_HIERARCHY_NME(component_hierarchy_defn table)=Account Number.
So here the root table is "component_defn cd which contain one column cd.n_comp_defn_id which is primary column and foreign column in
other above 3 table"
So total i have 4 table.My requirment is i want cd.v_comp_defn_nme,cd.v_comp_defn_id based on user input.
User having 3 option in ui can see,like component_request_measures,component_filter_defn,component_hierarchy_defn.
1)If user only select component_request_measures and its perticular column then we fetch cd.v_comp_defn_nme,cd.v_comp_defn_id based on 
component_defn and  component_request_measures(So here both table will join and v_comp_req_measure_formula will be the condition)
1)If user select component_request_measures,component_filter_defn and both tables perticular column then we fetch cd.v_comp_defn_nme,cd.v_comp_defn_id based on 
component_defn and  component_request_measures and component_filter_defn(So here three table will join and v_comp_req_measure_formula and V_FILTER_NME will be the condition)

similar way for below combination i need query, so its better if we can accumulate below scenario in one query

1) component_defn and  component_request_measures
2)component_defn and component_filter_defn
3)component_defn and component_hierarchy_defn
4)component_defn ,component_request_measures,component_filter_defn
5)component_defn ,component_request_measures,component_hierarchy_defn
6)component_defn ,component_request_measures,component_hierarchy_defn
7)component_defn ,component_request_measures,component_filter_defn,component_hierarchy_defn
